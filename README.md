######  Switzerland
It is one of my favourite place since childhood . **Switzerland** is known for being one of the most beautiful and serene place on earth. The Swiss seem to understand the __true meaning of serenity__ when it comes to world peace as well. The country is famous for being one of the most neutral countries in the world. I would like to explore many places in the switzerland
